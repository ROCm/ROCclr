* Note: ideally the DXX extension interfaces should be mapped from the DXX perforce branch. 
* This means CAL client spec will need to change to include headers directly from the DXX perforce tree. 
* However, CAL only cares about the DXX OpenCL extension interface class. The spec cannot change
* without notification. So it is safe to use a local copy of the relevant DXX extension interface classes.
